        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>At Clinton Senior High School, I work as an IT Assistant, where I provide technical support and troubleshooting for various devices and software applications. I am responsible for securing the computers in the school's different computer labs, using Windows 11 and cybersecurity tools. I also assist the IT department with other tasks, such as updating software, installing hardware, and resolving issues.</p>
        <p>I am currently pursuing my High School Diploma, with a strong interest in computer science and robotics. I am an honors student and a member of the National Honor Society, and I am taking AP classes related to these fields. I have also participated in the FIRST Robotics program, where I designed and programmed robots using Java and Onshape. I am motivated to learn more about the latest technologies and innovations, and to apply them to real-world problems and challenges.</p>
