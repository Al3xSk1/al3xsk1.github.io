        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            As an IT Assistant, I provide technical support and troubleshooting for various devices and software applications. I primarily Assist the IT dept. at my High School, where I work on securing the computers. I also have experience in cyber security, having completed a project-based internship at Work-Based Learning Alliance, where I learned how to protect networks and systems from cyber threats and attacks. I have earned the CompTIA IT Fundamentals+ certification, demonstrating my knowledge and skills in IT concepts and practices which I plan to advance in.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing my High School Diploma at Clinton Senior High School, where I am an honors student and a member of the National Honor Society. I have a strong interest in computer science and robotics, and I am pursuing AP classes related to these fields. I have also participated in the FIRST Robotics program, where I worked with Java and Onshape to design and program robots. I am motivated to learn more about the latest technologies and innovations, and to apply them to real-world problems and challenges.
